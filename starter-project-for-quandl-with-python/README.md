# Getting Started with OpenData from Quandl and Python

This is a simple Python project to demonstrate using opendata
from [Quandl](quandl.com) with Sense.

This project pulls [U.S. Household energy 
usage](https://www.quandl.com/data/UN/ELECTRICITYCONSUMPTIONBYHOUSEHOLDS_USA-Electricity-Consumption-By-Households-United-States-of-America
dataset) and loads it into a Pandas dataframe.
Then the project is available for further analysis.
