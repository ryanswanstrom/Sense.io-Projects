# A Project to build a single collection of Data Science Programs at Colleges and Universities

This project pulls data from 2 places and combines the list.

1. [Data Science Colleges | Data Science Community](http://datascience.community/colleges)
1. [Master's in Data Science](http://www.mastersindatascience.org/) - Huge thank you to 
 [Shivam Rana](https://twitter.com/TrigonaMinima) for providing
 the [source code for the web scraping](https://goo.gl/5wXcOJ).


The combined list will be located on Github as [Awesome Data Science Colleges](https://github.com/ryanswanstrom/awesome-datascience-colleges).
